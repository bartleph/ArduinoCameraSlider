The project uses a 5V Arduino Pro Mini to control two TMC2208 stepper motor drivers, one to pan the camera and one to rotate it. Inputs are made through a rotary pushbutton and the menus and parameter inputs are shown on a 128x64 I2C OLED display. The project guide includes a download for the PCB manufacturing files, this allows the components to be soldered onto a single PCB for a more robust and reliable build.

Please ask any project related questions or questions relating to the hardware and build process on the project guide.
